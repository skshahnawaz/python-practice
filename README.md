    1.2. Convert the above solution to a function.
    1.3. Find sum of prime numbers between 1000 and 2000.
    1.4. Read n numbers. Find the following parameters:
            a. Average
            b. Maximum
            c. Minimum
            d. Second maximum
            e. Second minimum
    1.5. Fibonacci series is defined as f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) with f(0) = 0
            and f(1) = 1. Hence the series is 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,... Now:
	    a. Find the n'th value of the series
	    b. Find the sum of first n Fibonacci numbers
